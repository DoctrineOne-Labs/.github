**Build secure systems for regulated missions.**

We write software for organizations where failure is not an option. Source code, documentation, and evidence - delivered.

---

## What We Build

Software for environments where the stakes are real. Healthcare systems that cannot go down. Defense platforms that must withstand scrutiny. Infrastructure that operators trust.

We work across three domains:

- **Secure Application Development** - Applications built for compliance-heavy environments with documentation that auditors understand
- **System Integration** - APIs, data pipelines, and dashboards with lineage tracking and rollback paths
- **AI-Enabled Applications** - LLM integration with guardrails, audit logs, and human-in-the-loop workflows

## How We Work

```
No subcontracting.     → Our engineers write every line.
Source code delivery.  → You own the repo. Full history.
Documentation ships.   → Architecture and runbooks, not afterthoughts.
Fixed-price.           → Clear scope. No hourly surprises.
Built for handoff.     → Day one, we design for the day you operate without us.
```

## Engineering Culture

We are a small team that writes code. No layers of project managers. No offshore handoffs. Engineers on every call, every commit, every decision.

We believe:
- Working software beats slide decks
- Evidence beats assertions
- Handoff-ready beats vendor lock-in
- Boring technology beats resume-driven development

## Tech

| | |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React, TypeScript, Vite |
| **Components** | Radix UI, Tailwind CSS |
| **Infrastructure** | Vercel Edge, Cloudflare, Foundry |
| **Platforms** | Software, Robotics, Drones |
| **Quality** | Strict TypeScript, ESLint, SonarLint |

We use boring, proven tools. The interesting problems are in the domain, not the stack.

## Open Source

We contribute to and build on open source. This repository contains our public-facing site and serves as an example of our engineering standards.
